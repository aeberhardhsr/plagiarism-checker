Pull up, skrrt-skrrt on your body
Performin' just like my 'Rari
You're too fine, need a ticket
I bet you taste expensive
Pourin' up, up, up by the liter
If you keepin' up, you's a keeper
Tequila and vodka
Girl, you might be a problem

Run away, run away, run away, run away, I know that I should
But my heart wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay now
You can see it in my eyes that I wanna take you down right now if I could
So I hope you know what I mean when I say

Let me take you dancin'
Two-step to the bedroom
We don't need no dancefloor
Let me see your best move
Anything could happen
Ever since I met you
No need to imagine
Baby, all I'm asking
Is let me take you dancing
