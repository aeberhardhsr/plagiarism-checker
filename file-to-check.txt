[Verse 2]
Pull up, skrrt-skrrt on your body
Performing just like my 'Rari
You are too fine, need a ticket
I bet you taste expensive
Pouring up, up, up by the liter
If you keeping up, you as a keeper
Tequila and vodka
Girl, you might be a problem

[Pre-Chorus]
Run away, run away, run away, run away, I know that I should
But my heart wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay now
You can see it in my eyes that I wanna take you down right now if I could
So I hope you know what I mean when I say

[Chorus]
Let me take you dancing
Two-step to the bedroom
We do not need no dancefloor
Let me see your best move
Anything could happen
Ever since I met you
No need to imagine
Baby, all I am asking
Is let me take you dancing
